If multiple Mezo systems allocate resources with the approximately the same proportions for an extended amount of time and those Mezo systems have more than 80% Mezono consensus to merge, those Mezo systems will merge into one Mezo system. (How is this similarity mathematically measured)

Mezo Systems must communicate with one another to send and receive proportion data as well as a collective list of citizens within their individual systems.

Once a person becomes of a citizen of a particular Mezo system, that citizen can not move to a different Mezo system.
